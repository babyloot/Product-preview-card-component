## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-view screen


### What I learned


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

As for me, i would add:
Use high-quality images to showcase the product's features. Make sure the images are clear and show the product from different angles.
Include a clear call-to-action button that encourages users to take action, such as "Buy Now" or "Learn More". The button should be prominently displayed and contrast with the rest of the card to draw attention.
Highlight the key features of the product to make it easier for users to understand its value proposition. This can be done through the use of icons, bullet points, or short descriptions.
